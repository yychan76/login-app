# Login Application

Create a login application.

The UI can be any programming language and the backend must be a RESTful webservice using Java.

Upon successful login, there should be a welcome page that shows the name, username and role (manager/user).

If the user has a manager role, the welcome page will have a link to access a restricted webpage.

This restricted webpage can only be accessed by a manager role and not by other user roles.

Do also implement logout functionality.

Notes:

- If the userid or password is not valid, I should remain at the login page with an error message
"Invalid userid or password".
- All data should be stored in a database.
- The application should demonstrate MVC pattern.

Bonus Question:

- The application should be able to support at least 2 languages (e.g. English, Mandarin).
